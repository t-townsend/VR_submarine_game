# VR Submarine Game

This game was built in Unity3D and C#, and was part of a workshop given by
Academy of VR. The 3D objects were provided, but I coded the game from scratch
using C#. The gameplay includes shooting, 360 degree control around the
environment, sound effects and collision triggers.

**Technology Used: Unity3D, C#**
